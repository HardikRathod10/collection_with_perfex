### Introduction
Laravel Collections are really powerful for working with arrays of data. They provide a fluent, convenient interface for performing common array operations, such as filtering, formatting and transforming data. In this blog post, we'll explore some of the key features of Laravel Collections and how they can be used to simplify and streamline your code.

### How to use collection?
To use collection we have to pass array as parameter to **collect()** it could be normal array or array generated by query result.
```
//Normal array
$collection_arr = collect([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]);
//Array generated by query result
$invoices = collect($this->collection_model->get_invoices());

```
### Collection Methods
Following are methods that you can use to perform operations with collection.
> Collection methods does not change actual collection variable but it will return filtered elements.
1. **filter()**:
   This method is used to filter elements from collection.
   ```
   //This will filter all invoices from collection which has status 2 and will store in $output.
   $output = $invoices->filter(fn($invoice) => $invoice['status'] == 2);
   ```
2. **where()**:
   where method used to filter collection elements base on passing key/value pairs
   ```
   //Will filter invoices which status is 1.
   $output = $invoices->where('status', 1);
   ```
3. **where()** with condition:
   We can create custom condition with where method by specifing conditional opertor at second argument.
   ```
   // Will filter invoices which total is greater than or equal to 1000.
   $output = $invoices->where('total', '>=', 1000)
   ```
4. **whereIn()**:
   whereIn method filter records which value match comes in specified array.
   ```
   // Will filter invoices which total is 500 or 700
   $output = $invoices->whereIn('total', [500, 700])
   ```
5. **whereBetween()**:
   whereBetween() method filters records which comes in specifiec range.
   ```
   // Will filter invoices which total is between 400 to 800
   $output = $invoices->whereBetween('total', [400, 800])
   ```
6. **first()**:
   first method will return first collection element.
   ```
   $output = $invoices->first();
   ```
7. **last()**:
   last method will return last collection element.
   ```
   $output = $invoices->last();
   ```
8. **isEmpty()**:
   Returns true if collection is **empty** else returns false.
   ```
   // Will store resutl in $output variable which will be True/False.
   $output = $invoices->isEmpty();
   ```
9. **isNotEmpty()**:
    Returns true if collection is not empty else returns false.
   ```
   // Will store resutl in $output variable which will be True/False.
   $output = $invoices->isNotEmpty();
   ```
